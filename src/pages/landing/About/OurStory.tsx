          Bethel School of Fashion and Design is situated in Atonsu-Agogo,
          within the Asokwa Municipality of the Ashanti Region, Ghana. The
          school operates from a two-story building along Lake Road, a prime
          location that has served the community since its founding. Established
          in 1999 by Mrs. Joana Ofori, Bethel initially began as a small
          workshop aimed at training apprentices in practical fashion skills.
          Over time, as more individuals sought training, the institution grew
          significantly.

          In 2020, the workshop evolved into the Bethel School of Fashion,
          combining both theoretical education and hands-on training to provide
          a comprehensive curriculum. The school now offers a wide range of
          courses, including Fashion and Design, Makeup Artistry, Millinery and
          Accessories, and Event Planning and Organization. These programs are
          designed to equip students with both creative and technical skills,
          preparing them for diverse roles in the fashion and events industries.
